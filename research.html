  <h3>Dissertation Project</h3>
  <p>I am a philosopher "in" science. My dissertation is a glimpse into the mutually beneficial interplay between science and philosophy. I deal with methodological and inferential issues regarding emerging topics and novel methods in climate and network science using philosophical analysis. </p>
  <p>On the one hand, science needs philosophy. Scientific results, regardless whether they are experimental results or simulation results, are not self-evident in what they tell us. To make sound interpretations, we have to make careful inferences from these results by thinking clearly about the methods employed to generate the results and the backgound knowledge in that specific scientific context. Various scientific methods have their intended domain of applications and questions that they are suitable for answering. </p>
  <p>On the other hand, philosophy needs science. Recent scientific development and attention to how science is really done has helped philosophers to remold notions such as "objectivity" "confirmation" "explanation". 
  <p>Topics include the "missing tree ring" hypothesis in paleo-climatology, machine learning and the problem of induction, and modeling climate as networks.</p>

  <h3> Anchoring in Paleo-dating </h3>
  <p>Paleoclimatology employs a variety of proxies to reconstruct past climate, including tree rings, lake sediment, ice cores, etc. To date them correctly is a cruical prerequiste for successful reconstructions. Lately, <a href = "https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14565" target=”_blank”>Sigl et al. (2015)</a> revised a Greenland ice core chronology by seven years. My collaborator <a href="[TODO: Ryan's webiste]" target="_blank">Ryan O'Loughlin</a> and I aim to explain how this revision is justified, the importance of anchoring in dating, and how it is done.</p>

  <h3> Does Universality Makes a difference? </h3>
  <h4> the predicament of the universality approach</h4>
  <p>The universality approach in philosophy of science argues that finding the universality class in nature is a justification for scientific modeling, distinct from difference-making approach, which states that models are "good enough" representations and tools to study nature because idealizations made in models do not make a difference to the modeling results. I argue that the universality approach is difference-making under disguise.</p>
