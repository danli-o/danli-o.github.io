    <h2>News</h2>
    <p><li>(May 2021) My paper "If a Tree Grows No Ring and No One is Around: how scientists deal with missing tree rings" won the <b>Norwood Russell Hanson Prize for Outstanding Graudate Student Papers</b> at Indiana University. See <a href="https://hpsc.indiana.edu/graduate/fellowships/hanson.html"target=”_blank”>official website</a>.</li></p>

    <h2>Research Interest<h2>
    <h3>A re-occurring theme in my research is...</h3>
    <p>... the intimate interplay between philosophy and science: philosophy of science without adequate scientific knowledge is crippled, and science without philosophical reflections and rigorous reasoning is blind—to borrow from Lakatos. It is my conviction that philosophers, with sufficient training in science, can help scientists resolve some critical debates, formulate research questions, and plan out research road maps, and that scientists, with patience to explain their work to philosophers, can help philosophers explore epistemological issues that eventually shed light on reason, rationality, and the nature of science.</p>

      <h3>Climate Science</h3>
      <p>Having a minor in Earth and Atmospheric science, I am interested in the new tools employed in climate science, including machine learning and other novel statistical methods. </p>
      <p>Here's my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hJxmlRipu8nwjxyTpyfc9Wq0pAwWRN2C/view?usp=sharing" target=”_blank”>latest manuscript on issues in climate science.</a> Comment as you want!</p>

      <h3>Philosophy of Science</h3>
      <p>I major in philosophy of science and am interested in traditional epistemological questions such as how to offer appropriate epistemic criteria to evaluate scientific tools and methods. I am also avid about crafting philosophical tools to aid scientific investigations, such as applying Elisabeth Lloyd's <a href = "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13752-015-0214-2" target=”_blank”>(2015)</a> Logic of Research Questions. </p>

      <h3>Network Science</h3>
      <p>I double major in complex network & systems. I am especially interested in the inferential strategies along the networks constructed by scientists.</p>
