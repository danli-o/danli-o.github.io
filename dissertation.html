    <h2>Frontiers in Climate Science: a methodological inquiry</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>My dissertation research intersects with philosophy of science, climate science, and network science, with a focus on addressing methodological issues. A re-occurring theme in my research is the intimate interplay between philosophy and science: philosophy of science without adequate scientific knowledge is crippled, and science without philosophical reflections and rigorous reasoning is blind—to borrow from Lakatos. It is my conviction that philosophers, with sufficient training in science, can help scientists resolve some critical debates, formulate research questions, and plan out research road maps, and that scientists, with patience to explain their work to philosophers, can help philosophers explore epistemological issues that eventually shed light on reason, rationality, and the nature of science. </p>
  <p>The interplay between science and philosophy has always been the centerpiece of the philosophy of science dinner table. Yet, how that interplay pans out largely depends on the philosophical movement at the time and what we philosophers believe to be the right way of doing philosophy of science. Although they do not always agree with each other, logical positivists in the early 20th century are primarily concerned with scientific methodology and the important role of science in reshaping philosophy (and society). On the one hand, logical positivists believe there has to be a rational reconstruction of scientific theories, confirmation, and explanations, in which logic and mathematics play a crucial and irreplaceable role for understanding the scientific enterprise. For example, according to Carl Hempel’s deductive-nomological model, a scientific explanation consists of an explanandum (statements describing the phenomenon to be explained) and an explanans (statements used to explain, usually including at least one law of nature), with the former being a deductive consequence of the latter. Logic is expected to lay down the ironclad principles of what it is to explain, to be a piece of evidence, and to confirm or falsify a theory. On the other hand, the empiricist root of logical positivism also pushes logical positivists to articulate a “scientific philosophy” and to defend it against metaphysics, which is deemed as unscientific, meaningless, and senseless (Carnap 1932). Although not often elaborated in the text book, philosophers of science during this period of time are also highly involved with analyzing the scientific work of the day in great details, such as Hans Reichenbach on the foundations of probability, and they have also influenced a new generation of scientists, such as Rudolf Carnap and his student Walter Pitts, the father of artificial neural networks (Kardum 2020). </p>
  <p>However, no one has been able to lay down the unalterable scientific method, the ironclad logical structure of science. Taking science as problem-solving, Thomas Kuhn and other philosopher of historicism study historical cases in which scientific discoveries are made and knowledge gained. This is certainly a topic not engaged in by logical positivists. Regardless of whether the division between “normal science” and “revolutionary science” is applicable to real science or merely a crude reconstruction of history, philosophers are now free to look at the functional, sociological, and cultural dimensions of scientific practices. For philosophers with a preference of formalism and airtight logic to represent rationality, the attention to the messy social context in which science occurs is frightening. Yet it is also fruitful. We ended up with a spectrum of perspectives regarding the rationality behind science. On one end of the spectrum, we have Paul Feyerabend’s Against Method: anarchistic theory of knowledge (1973), in which he concludes that there are no useful methodological rules governing scientific progress. The history is so complex that the only useful rule is “anything goes.” On the other end, in Science as Social Knowledge: values and objectivity in scientific inquiry (1990), Helen Longino demonstrates that the exact social nature of scientific collaboration, peer review, and constructive criticism, has made scientific enterprise objective. </p>
  <p>In the 1980s and 90s, philosophy of science branched to be about specific scientific disciplines. In the meantime, there was a naturalistic turn as to “how real philosophy of science is done.” Werner Callebaut (1993) has documented his conversations with many philosophers of science in practice at the time in the book Taking the Naturalistic Turn or How Real Philosophy of Science Is Done. Callebaut writes “Naturalism as a philosophical movement claims that whatever exists or happens in the world is susceptible to explanation by natural scientific methods; it denies that there is or could be anything which lies in principle beyond the scope of scientific explanation”. Ronald Giere (1985) also argues that “a naturalized philosophy of science… is the only viable approach to the philosophy of science” (331). The central task of philosophy of science has evolved to be understanding how science actually works, in contrast to how science is justified, rational, or progressive as the centerpieces of previous movements. This requires naturalistic philosophers of science to have one foot in science and closely engage with scientists.</p>
  <p>A potential objection against naturalism is that a naturalistic approach will reduce philosophy of science to be merely descriptive, instead of normative. However, this is an extremely weak objection because it presupposes that attention to scientific details is equivalent to “descriptive” and that nothing normative can arise out of such attention. Arguments need not be made for rebuttal against this objection because numerous studies in the naturalistic approach that addresses specific scientific issues in a variety of disciplines have proven to not only describe scientific methods and criteria as is, but more importantly, they also prescribe the appropriate evidential criteria and admissible scientific theories. </p>
  <p>Practice-oriented philosophers of science have been recasting traditional philosophical questions via their engagement with scientific practice and their intimate work with scientific knowledge. These questions include the nature of concepts, such as objectivity (Longino 1990; Lloyd and Schweizer 2014), confirmation (Lloyd 2015a), mechanism, value-free science, theory-ladenness, under-determination, semantic view of explanation, pluralism (Longino 2012), empiricism (Lloyd 2012). They have also been crafting new philosophical tools to aid scientific investigations (e.g., the logic of research questions (Lloyd 2016) and addressing scientific debates (Li, forthcoming). </p>
  <p>It is impossible to give a succinct overview of the plethora of the work in philosophy of biology, economics, statistics, physics, to name only a few. Nonetheless, two schools of thoughts heavily influenced my intellectual growth during Ph.D. training. One is from philosophy of biology with a feminist and pragmatist touch, work done by scholars who are primarily philosophers but scientifically trained and engaged. The other is the complex system thinking, heirloom of the cybernetics movements of 1950s. The variety of system thinking is formulated by scientific practitioners in system biology, computer science, neural science, etc., who are often philosophically minded. </p>
  <p>There is a myriad of exciting problems in philosophy of biology. For example, for well-educated laymen, evolutionary theory is generally treated as a single, simple, monolithic theory epitomized by “survival of the fittest.” However, nothing could be further from the truth. Evolutionary biology is a diverse, heterogenous, and messy collection of inquiries, concepts, and approaches, which may be plagued with erroneous reasoning. Philosophers of biology aim to sort things out. For example, Elisabeth Lloyd, in her book The Case of the Female Orgasm: bias in the science of evolution (2005), has summarized dozens of theories—thirty year worth of research—regarding the evolutionary account of female orgasms and distilled the most likely theory by pointing out the flaws in many accounts, including crappy data, biased and unsubstantiated assumptions, and motivated reasoning fueled by adaptationism (the idea that all traits have an evolutionary function) and androcentrism (the idea that female sexuality is like male sexuality). </p>
  <p>Later, Lloyd (2015b; 2016) developed a framework of Logic of Research Question (LRQ) that helps scientists to think about evolutionary questions: before we ask “what is the evolutionary function of a trait?”, we must answer “Does this trait has an evolutionary function?”. LRQ has prompted me to think about a recent debate in climate science and I, by reverse-engineering the research questions that the methodologies (and associated research) can indeed answer, show that scientists of either party are not directly addressing the matter of the debate. See Chapter 2 (more below). </p>
  <p>My second influence comes from system thinking. George Klir in his book Faucets of Systems Science (2001) defines system science as “a science whose domain of inquiry consists of those properties of systems and associated problems that emanates from the general notion of systemhood” (5). Systems are defined with a set of things (the properties of which is called “thinghood”) and the relations between things (the properties of which is called “systemhood”). Systems, as Klir (2001) conceives them, “do not exist in the real world independent of the human mind. They are created by the acts of making distinctions in the real world or, possibly, in the world of ideas” (12, original italics). To Klir, this type of constructivist view is “not an ontological view (concerned with the existence and ultimate nature of reality), but an epistemological view (concerned with the origin, structure, acquisition, and validity of knowledge… it is undoubtedly the predominant view in contemporary system science” (13). Although social constructivism was a popular idea with a spectrum of stands, one can clearly see Klir’s “constructivist view of reality” echoes Bas van Fraassen’s “constructivist empiricism” articulated in his book The Scientific Image (1980), which states that “Science aims to give us theories which are empirically adequate; and acceptance of a theory involves as belief only that it is empirically adequate” (12, original italics). </p>
  <p>System thinking, emphasis on the interconnectedness and the interactions between entities—in addition to entities themselves, has bred a complex network and system science with a particularly strong linkage with computing technologies. Historically, the school of thoughts has lineage with cyberneticians, who are interested in information theory, computing technology, neural science, and artificial intelligence (Heims 1991). With computing capacity steadily increase in the last decades, network models have proven to be fruitful partly because computers are especially good at handling graph objects (the mathematical construct for networks), partly because of the availability of large volume of data in this information age. The scientific results also give rise to novel philosophical problems, such as “downward causation” (Bechtel 2017; Green 2018; Woodward 2020) and “scale-freeness” (Bechtel 2015; Green 2018; Holme 2019) [cite my ESPA paper]. There are, surely, methodological questions such as “what network models can tell us?” This is the motivation of my chapter 5 “The Missing Link in Inference with Climate Networks”, focusing on modeling climate as networks, in which I argue the faulty interpretation of climate networks stems from a mismatch between network results and the epistemic goal of scientists to discover climate mechanisms, hence an inferential issue. (More below.)</p>
  <p>Despite that I find there are intimate and fruitful interactions between philosopher and scientists, reality can be difficult for this line of research, parallel to the practice-oriented feminist philosophy of science. In summarizing the recent contribution of feminist philosophy of science to both science and philosophy, Richardson (2010) laments, “there is a mismatch between the significance of case study analysis of science for the development of the philosophy and practice of science on the one hand, and the prestige that the discipline of philosophy awards such work on the other. Journal referees, funding sources, graduate training, and tenure demands often brand case study work, dismissively, as “applied” philosophy of science, and yet it represents some of the most socially relevant work in philosophy of science” (348). </p>
  <p>Echoing the division among philosophers of science, Zautra (2018) interviewed 30 active philosophers of science over 2016-18 and found over 40% interviewees are concerned with philosophy of science involving “too little science” while roughly the same proportion are concerned with philosophy of science involving “too much science.” The third most prominent concern expressed was “too little philosophy.” </p>
  <p>Admittedly it is not easy to strike the right balance between science and philosophy when we are engaged with interdisciplinary work. However, the familiarity with science is a prerequisite for better philosophy work as demonstrated in my chapter 4, in which I articulate scientific concepts in the context of machine learning and argue why certain philosophical claims do not hold water if we set the science straight first. Further, it shows that only when we understand science correctly, will we be in a position to give appropriate epistemic criteria to evaluate scientific tools and results. Similarly, having knowledge regarding the philosophical roots of certain modern scientific tools will inform scientists with better modeling decisions. In my chapter 3 “Don’t Make Machine Learning ‘Gruesome’” I show machine learning, as automatic induction, has the deep connections between Hume’s problem of induction and Goodman’s new riddle of induction, and thus scientists should seriously consider incorporating learning biases (such as conservation) to constrain the model training. </p>
  <p>  Overall, my dissertation is a glimpse into what could be done to enhance this mutually beneficial relationship for the betterment of science and philosophy. Chapter 2 “If a Tree Grows No Ring and No One is Around: how scientists deal with missing tree rings” examines a recent debate in dendroclimatology regrading a missing tree ring (MTR) hypothesis that states, due to drastic summer cooling induced by extreme volcanic eruptions, a large number of trees did not grow an annual ring, therefore causing the climate model vs. paleodata discrepancy that we see today. Some dendroclimatologists (e.g., Kevin Anchukaitis, Rosanne D’Arrigo, Jan Esper, and Scott St. George) responded strongly to Michael Mann’s MTR hypothesis. Both parties presented evidence and arguments as to why the MTR hypothesis is unlikely or not. I show that arguments presented by both parties are flawed. In a sense, both parties offered a type of (vicious) circular arguments that either re-stated their starting point (i.e., assuming large-scale missing rings are impossible) or stated what we already know (i.e., paleo-data during extreme eruptions is unreliable compared with the rest if we assume climate models to be the ground truth). On the one hand, dendrochronologists’ cross dating method would never allow the MTR hypothesis to gain any evidential support if it were true. On the other hand, Mann and colleagues’ implementation of Monte Carlo simulation and hypothesis testing is also flawed and offers no convincing support for the MTR hypothesis. In this case, I explain a few scientific concepts: “cross dating” “Monte Carlo simulation” “hypothesis testing”, and offer a cogent and robust line of reasoning to settle the debate. This chapter demonstrates how careful philosophical analysis and attention to scientific details can shed light on scientific debates. </p>
  <p>Chapter 3 “Don’t Make Machine Learning ‘Gruesome’: the importance of learning biases in earth system science applications” aims to disclose the intimate relationship between the cutting-edge methods in machine learning and the age-old problem of induction, especially on the relationship between No Free Lunch theorem and Goodman’s new riddle of induction. By emphasizing that machine learning is an automated inductive procedure, I highlight a few points: (1) the i.i.d. (independently identically distributed) assumption is analogous to Hume’s Principle of the Uniformity of Nature, both of which serve as postulates for induction to work; (2) there is no universal solution to induction, and thus (3) we must rely on case-specific domain-specific knowledge and close examine the problem at hand. This motivates why inductive biases are not only ideal, but necessary for successful machine learning applications. Due to the complexity of the problems in Earth system science and the sparsity of data, the importance of incorporating learning biases during training is even more prominent. Then I show how at each stage of training, machine learning applications can incorporate learning biases informed by domain knowledge to constrain and optimize the training. This case exemplifies and makes explicit the deep connections between philosophical problems and cutting-edge scientific methods. Furthermore, I think it is crucial to deliver this message to scientists who want to employ machine learning to aid their discovery, because by putting humans back into machine learning, we will build better tools. </p>
  <p>Chapter 4 examines Kawamleh’s philosophical analysis on the epistemic implications of neural-network-based parameterizations. I argue that a misunderstanding in machine learning terminology has contributed to her analysis that does not hold under scrutiny. Climate scientists have started to harness the predictive power of machine learning to aid climate model development, especially in developing parameterization schemes, ways to represent small-scale processes in large-grid climate models. Kawamleh claims that such practices undermine the reliability of climate models because neural-network-based parameterizations do not generalize well. The failure of generalizability, she claims, is because neural-network-based parameterizations do not represent any physical processes directly or indirectly. However, by analyzing her argument, I show that her conclusion is due to a series of misunderstandings in machine learning terminology, namely, “learning” “generalizability” “overfitting” and “representation.” Lastly, I argue that the distinction between indirect, direct, and a lack of, representation of physical process is rather arbitrary and unhelpful. Instead, we should treat both neural-network-based and physics-based parameterizations as legitimate representations of physical process, which lie on the spectrum between observation-driven vs. theory-driven. Note that purely “theory-driven” applications in climate science are extremely rare with the majority being a hybrid between observation- and theory-driven. </p>
  <p>Chapter 5 “The Missing Link in Inferences with Climate networks” focuses on the recent applications of network models on climate data. Network models have proven to be fruitful in many fields for their capacity to model interactions between entities. Climate networks are constructed using climatic variables across geographical distance. I first lay out a number of issues related to contemporary climate network research and especially the interpretation of these networks. For example, some long-range correlations are spuriously interpreted to be related to Rossby waves, even though the latter is studied under the Newtonian mechanic framework, not the network model approach. Then, as a point of contrast, I study some cases in system biology presented by Bechtel (2019) and identify a few crucial elements in the success of protein-protein/gene networks: (1) the interactions, represented by the edges between nodes in a network, are real and experimentally established in a lab setting; (2) inference made along the network is based on known mechanisms (e.g., known biological functions of certain proteins) and a “guilty-by-association” inferential strategy (e.g., proteins that are highly clustered tend to be involved in the same biological function). In contrast, climate networks have neither of these elements. The interactions are neither real nor between real entities but are only statistical correlations between climatic variables. There are no “known mechanisms” for us to make inferences from. Furthermore, although system biology networks are fruitful and regarded as successful, network models are merely heuristics for discovery. Discoveries of biological mechanisms are still made in an interventionist sprit, experimentally in a lab, after network models suggest potential candidates for new discoveries. Thus, I urge climate network researchers drop any spurious interpretation regarding mechanistic discoveries in climate networks, because network methodology applied on climate data clearly do not promise this type of findings. Instead, scientists should focus on looking for constant and stable associations, because although mechanistic discoveries are beyond immediate reach using network models, constant associations can have value in terms of predictive power. </p>
  <p>These relatively independent but overlapping chapters collectively demonstrate one fruitful way to do philosophy of science: doing philosophy in science, by being consciously aware of the relevant philosophical problems lurking within and beyond the science realm, understanding scientific knowledge and being attentive to details, and being actively engaged with scientific practice. I am certainly not unique as a philosopher “in” science. Chapter 6 “Conclusion: doing philosophy ‘in’ science” aims to offer a sample of this rare breed of philosophers in science and my personal reflection on the value of this line of work. The scholars who inspired me include, but are not limited to, Elisabeth Lloyd, Amit Hagar, Helen Longino, William Bechtel, John Bickle, Cailin O’Connor... Regardless of whether they count themselves as philosophers in science or philosophically minded scientists, by reviewing their work and contributions, I identify myself as a member in the gang and further highlight a few meta-methodological reflections on how to do philosophy of science better. </p>
